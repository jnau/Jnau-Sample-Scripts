# Matlab/Octave

These folders contain scripts written in Matlab/Octave for certain projects and courses. 

## Action Potential Dynamics

Project from D. Sato, Ph.D Lab (https://dsatolab.github.io/Site/). Studied how phenomena from the slope of the APD restitution curve in 0D correlated to 2D waves. Folder contains a script to find the APD at time = n+1 to plot the APD restitution curve for certain pacing cycle lengths.

## Calcium Dynamics

Project from D. Sato, Ph.D Lab (https://dsatolab.github.io/Site/). Studying calcium dynamics in the dyadic space using random walks, a stochastic process underlying diffusion. Mathematical modeling.

## Numerical Analysis

Projects containing certain algorithm implementations for numerical analysis.
