# Calcium Dynamics

## Scripts

CaDiffusion.cpp 

This C++ script is meant to implement a calcium wave in one dimension using a stochastic process. We will be using random walks to simulate a wave with similarities to the diffusion PDE. Since random walks are the fundementals of pdes, we want to study this behavior.
