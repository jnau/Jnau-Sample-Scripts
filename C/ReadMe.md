# C/C++

This folder organizes my scripts based on the topic they were scripted for.

## Calcium Dynamics

These are any C/C++ scripts that were used in my Calcium Dynamics research. 

## Data Structure and Algorithm

These scripts were all written as part of lab assignments in a computer science course. The course title was Data Abstraction and Structures- where we were tasked with implementing containers and data structures and specific algorithms using those container and structures. Containers/structures includes doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, and graphs. Algorithms include searching, sorting, traversal, and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Games

Also a part of class projects, these were scripts to create games like Tetris and Connect Four. More information will be provided in this folder, as some were in collaboration with others.

## Other

These are any scripts that do not fall into any category above. Most are small scripts to do small tasks, like conversions or obtain change from a large sum of money.
