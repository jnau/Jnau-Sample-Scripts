# Sample
This repository contains some examples of my projects.

# BalancingTree.cpp
Given a degenerate binary tree, we use AVL rotations in order to generate a height balanced tree. In C++.

# LCS_Problem.py
Using Integer Linear Programming, we solve the Longest Common Subsequence Problem for DNA sequence analysis. In Python.

# Deterministic.m
Given the k-function for the opening of a Ryanodine Receptor, we calculate the opening probability. Done in Matlab.

# MolecularDynamics.m
Given the number of ions and size of the system, we model the movement of these ions using the verlet algorithm and specific boundary conditions.In Matlab.
