# Python

This folder organizes the scripts according to the projects they were written for. 

## Other
These are any python scripts written for courses taken at UC Davis, and for fun.

# Mechanical Firefly
This folder contains the scripts we used to model the Fitzhugh-Nagumo/Hogkin-Huxley models in order to synchronize our mechanial fireflies
using the Raspberry Pi 3. 

# LCS_problem.py
As part of the final project for a special topics course in computer science, known as Integer Linear Programming for Computational Biologists, we decided to see how the Longest Common Subsequence problem could be solved using integer linear programming and how that compared to dynamic programming using a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This python program takes in two DNA sequences and outputs a file to be used by Gurobi Optimizer to find the solutions. DNA sequences we used were referened by Influenza fron BLAST.
