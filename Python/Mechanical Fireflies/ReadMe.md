# Mechanical Firefly Project

Group project where we created mechanical fireflies using the Raspberry Pi 3 and had them synchronize their frequencies as would live fireflies in the wild. For a demonstration, go to https://dsatolab.github.io/Site/ __-> Gallery -> Digital Fireflies__.

This was a group collaboration. Modeled with the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system and Hodgkin-Huxley.
